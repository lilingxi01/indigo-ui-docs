# Welcome!

## Concept

We have a design criteria in mind while making the design prototype. Our goal is to deliver a customized industry-level user experience to our customer. In order to make UI consistent and keep the maintainability, we build a pack of UI components, so all teams in Track 2 can directly use it on their pages.

To better improve UI and UX while using Indigo UI, you may need to re-think about the design of your page, so you can use most out of Indigo UI Components to improve your section. Check out **Design Criteria** and **Design Prototype**!

{% content-ref url="design-criteria.md" %}
[design-criteria.md](design-criteria.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="design-prototype.md" %}
[design-prototype.md](design-prototype.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## UI Components

{% content-ref url="components/bptextinput.md" %}
[bptextinput.md](components/bptextinput.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="components/bpbutton.md" %}
[bpbutton.md](components/bpbutton.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="components/bpdomainselector.md" %}
[bpdomainselector.md](components/bpdomainselector.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="components/bpcheckbox.md" %}
[bpcheckbox.md](components/bpcheckbox.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="components/bpcheckboxgroup.md" %}
[bpcheckboxgroup.md](components/bpcheckboxgroup.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Credits

Indigo UI is hand-crafted by [all team members](https://github.com/david-fisher/320-S22-Track2/wiki/Indigo) from Indigo Development.

Some components, features, and interaction designs are inspired by [Defined Elements React](https://github.com/defined-elements/react), which is Lingxi's in-developing cross-platform open-source UI project. It is still under initial development, so you may not have access to it before it starts alpha testing, but you can still see some amazing designs and details right out-of-box in the Clog system.

If you have any question related to the documentation or the usage of our components, feel free to contact Lingxi through Slack.
