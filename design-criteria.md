# Design Criteria

## Colors

{% hint style="info" %}
The **color palette** is located at `front-end/utils/business-process/standards.js`.
{% endhint %}

The main (brand) color of Clog is designed to be `#16a34a` (referenced as `BPColors.green[600]` ).

Inactive border should use `gray` as a color basis. Active border should use `green` as a color basis.

## Dimensions

{% hint style="info" %}
The **dimension board** is located at `front-end/utils/business-process/standards.js`.
{% endhint %}

For sizes (dimensions) like border width, corner radius, and toolbar height, please refer to `BPDimens` for a consistent dimensionality among the entire system.

## Standards

{% hint style="info" %}
**Standard properties** are all located at `front-end/utils/business-process/standards.js`.
{% endhint %}

For standard properties like inactive border setup, active border setup, and box shadow, please refer to `BPStandards` for a consistent look among the entire system.
